#1. Creating a virtual environment. Using a virtual environment is optional
# but it is a good practice to keep your project dependencies isolated. Run
# the command below to create a virtual environment named 'myenv'.
# python3 -m venv myenv


#2. Activating the virtual environment. This step is necessary to ensure that
# your project's dependencies are installed in the virtual environment. Run the
# command below to activate the virtual environment called myenv.
# On Windows:
# myenv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux and macOS:
# source myenv/bin/activate


#3. Installing Django. Once the virtual environment is activated, you can
# install Django using the command below.
# pip install Django


#4. Verifying the installation. To check if Django is installed correctly,
# run the command below.
# django-admin --version
# If Django is installed correctly, it will display the version number.
