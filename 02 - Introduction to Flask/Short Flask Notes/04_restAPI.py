#1. Introduction to REST APIs
# - REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style
# used for designing networked applications using stateless communication.
# - REST APIs allow different software systems to communicate over HTTP.

# - Important Terminologies:
    # - Endpoint: An endpoint is the URL that contains the domain,
        # port, path and query parameters to access a specific resource.
    # - HTTP methods: They include GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. These methods can
        # can also be represented as CRUD (C = Create = POST, R = Read = GET, U = Update = PUT,
        #  D = Delete = DELETE).  
    # - HTTP Headers: Information such authentication tokens or cookies can be contained in the
        # HTTP request header.

# - Key principles of REST include:
    # - Stateless: Each request must contain all information needed to process it
    # - Client-Server: Clear separation between client and server responsibilities
    # - Uniform Interface: Consistent way to interact with resources
    # - Cacheable: Responses should be cacheable when appropriate
    # - Layered System: Architecture can have multiple layers
    # - Code on Demand (optional): Server can send executable code to client

# REST vs RPC
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# |   REST                      |             RPC                      |
# -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
# | Resource-based              |     Action-based                     |
# | Uses HTTP methods naturally |     Methods encoded in URL or body   |
# | /books/123                  |      /getBook?id=123                 |
# | Stateless                   |     Can be stateful                  |
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# HTTP Methods in REST APIs
# - GET: Retrieve data(Read)
# - POST: Create new resource(Create)
# - PUT: Update existing resource(Update/Replace)
# - PATCH: Partially update existing resource(Update/Modify)
# - DELETE: Remove resources(Delete)

# Typical REST API Endpoints Structure
# GET    /books           # Get all books
# POST   /books           # Create a new book
# GET    /books/123       # Get book with ID 123
# PUT    /books/123       # Update book with ID 123
# DELETE /books/123       # Delete book with ID 123


#2. JSON 
# - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange 
#  format. It's easy to read and write for humans and machines.

# - Example:
'''
{
  "title": "The Great Gatsby",
  "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
  "year": 1925,
  "genres": ["Classic", "Fiction"],
  "available": true
}
'''

# JSON Components
# - Objects: {} - Collections of key-value pairs
# - Arrays: [] - Ordered lists of values
# - Keys: Always strings (in quotes)
# - Values: strings, numbers, booleans, objects, arrays, null

# JSON in HTTP Requests/Responses
# JSON is the standard format for REST API communication:
    # - Request body: Client sends JSON data to server
    # - Response body: Server returns JSON data to client
    # - Content-Type header: application/json

# Working with JSON in Flask
# Flask provides built-in functions for JSON handling:
'''
from flask import request, jsonify

# Get JSON from request
data = request.get_json()

# Return JSON response
return jsonify({"message": "Success"})
'''
